The frameworks most used in this project were: express, bycript and jwt.
Express so we can start and communicate with a server, bycript so we can work with our passwords with more security and jwt so we can have tokens for logins.


authRoutes.js: Create the routes, simulate data set and create Post routes for log in e sign up.
server.js: Create the server on port 3000.
